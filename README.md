# Data Pipeline Project

This project implements a data pipeline for ingesting, processing, and analyzing data from various sources.
## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a robust and scalable data pipeline that can:

1. **Ingest data** from various sources such as SQL databases, CSV files, and APIs.
2. **Process data** to clean, transform, and aggregate it for analysis.
3. **Analyze data** to extract meaningful insights and generate reports.

## Architecture

The pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Modules to ingest data from different sources.
2. **Data Processing**: Steps to clean and transform the data.
3. **Data Storage**: Storing processed data in a suitable format for analysis.
4. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the data to extract insights and generate reports.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Tracking the progress and performance of the pipeline.


## Pipeline Components

### Data Ingestion

Modules to ingest data from various sources:

- **SQL Databases**: Uses SQLAlchemy to connect and query databases.
- **CSV Files**: Reads data from local or web-hosted CSV files using pandas.

### Data Processing

Steps to clean, transform, and aggregate the data:

- **Cleaning**: Handles missing values, corrects data types, and removes duplicates.
- **Transformation**: Applies necessary transformations such as normalization and feature engineering.
- **Aggregation**: Aggregates data to generate summary statistics.


### Data Analysis

Analyzes the data to extract insights and generate reports:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performs statistical tests and analysis.
- **Reporting**: Generates reports and dashboards.
